# musicplayer
have you ever wanted to be able to play your spotify playlists offline, but dont wanna pay for premium? this program allows you to play mp3 files from a chosen folder with the ability to skip and shuffle.  for use with spotdl (https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), which allows you to convert your spotify playlists to mp3s.

USE:
first off, you wanna go to spotdl (see above link) and follow all the instructions there. once you have all of the mp3s you want to play, put them all in a folder and place the folder wherever you like. 

you also need python3, i cant be assed explaining how to get python so just google a guide. honestly if you have a github account theres like a 95% chance you also have python installed so i probably dont need to explain this to you.

now, download the musicplayer file, pick the version that works for your OS. (assuming i make a version for anything other than mac)

MAC INSTALLATION:
once you have the mac version of the file, you want to place in in the bin folder inside your user folder. if you dont have one, thats ok. you just gotta make one through this command: mkdir ~/bin. there should now be a bin folder inside your user folder.

move the musicplayer file from your downloads into the bin folder.

now, open up your terminal and type in "musicplayer <name of folder with mp3s> (idk why its blue)
it should now start playing one of the mp3s in the folder. 
this will work no matter your internet connection and without ads. good for plane rides.
