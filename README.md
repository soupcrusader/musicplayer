# musicplayer
have you ever wanted to be able to play your spotify playlists offline, but dont wanna pay for premium? this program allows you to play mp3 files from a chosen folder with the ability to skip and shuffle.  for use with spotdl (https://github.com/spotDL/spotify-downloader), which allows you to convert your spotify playlists to mp3s.


INSTALLATION:

first off, you need to aquire the mp3 files. i use spotdl (see above link) to get my music as it can do entire playlists quite quickly, but the executable will work no matter how you get the songs. once you have them, place them all in a folder somewhere. it doesnt matter where (unless you have multiple drives, i havent tested how the program works with the executable and the song folder being in different drives so just keep them in the same one).

to run the program you need python3. I cant be assed explaining how to get python so just google a guide. honestly if you have a github account theres like a 95% chance you also have python installed so i probably dont need to explain this to you.

now, download the musicplayer file, pick the version that works for your OS. (assuming i make a version for anything other than mac)

MAC INSTALLATION:
once you have the mac version of the file, you want to place it in the bin folder inside your user folder. if you dont have one, thats ok. you just gotta make one through this command: mkdir ~/bin.

move the musicplayer file from your downloads into the bin folder.

now, open up your terminal and type in "musicplayer (name of folder with mp3s)"

it should now start playing one of the mp3s in the folder at random.

this will work no matter your internet connection and without ads. good for long plane/car rides.
